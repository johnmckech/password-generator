# password-generator

This repository features a deployed application wherein the use can click a button to generate a random password containing any character (upper case, lower case, number, special character). The user is prompted to enter a number between 8 and 128 to determine the length of the password, and then the password is generated to meet that specific criteria. This is achieved by creating a function in javascript that is linked to an HTML page that is also styled with a separate CSS sheet.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65624156/84611901-af688480-ae84-11ea-9e14-07a31ad68a2a.png)
