# password-generator

This repository features a deployed application wherein the use can click a button to generate a random password containing any character (upper case, lower case, number, special character). The user is prompted to enter a number between 8 and 128 to determine the length of the password, and then the password is generated to meet that specific criteria. This is achieved by creating a function in javascript that is linked to an HTML page that is also styled with a separate CSS sheet.
